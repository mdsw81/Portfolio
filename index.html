      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/PersonalPhoto.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="MarkSW">
      
        <p>I am a product of both Minnesota (in the very beginning) and Iowa (junior high, high school, and college.) I graduated from Iowa State University with a degree in vocal music education, certified to teach music from K-12.
        </p>
      
        <p>My first professional gig was teaching grades 7-12 vocal music in a small high school in NW Iowa. I moved to Denver, Colorado and taught music for the next 6 years at the elementary level. I then moved to Minnesota where I've been for over 20 years. For most of that time, I was a music editor and project manager of print music for a publisher/media company in Minneapolis. In August of 2017, I was let go due to departmental restructuring and now find myself in a new career trajectory.
        </p>

        <p>I currently work part-time as a customer support representative for a small tech company called SignaSource.com.
